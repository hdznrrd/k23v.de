We're offering custom branding opportunities to add a unique touch of spice to your events and presents.

# Custom Label

* Custom front labels in your design

Custom labels for items that are currently in stock are possible with lead times between two and three weeks.

Please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@k23v.de">info@k23v.de</a> to discuss design, volume, and pricing.

# Custom Label Option on Future Batches

* Custom front labels in your design

If our stock is too low for what you're planning, just let us know.
With enough lead time we can allocate product for you you in an upcoming production batch.

Lead times for options can be measured in weeks to months, depending on seasonal availability of raw product as well as the total number of booked options to date (starting a ferment for a low number of ordered bottles is not practical).

Please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@k23v.de">info@k23v.de</a> to discuss options.

# Fully Custom Sauce

* Custom front labels in your design
* Custom selection of chilis and spices
* Custom selection of processing (raw, boiled, or fermented)
* Custom bottle shape
* Custom bottle size

We design a fully custom sauce for you, using your favorite chili or mix of chilies as well as the possibility to add the exact spice blend you crave.
Of course this will include fully custom labels and your choice of bottle types and sizes.

Lead times are comparable to the previous option, though we'll prioritize your order and processing will start virtually immediately without wait for other option batches (pending sufficient production capabilities).

Please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@k23v.de">info@k23v.de</a> to discuss options and minimum order quantities.
