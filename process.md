Our products are made on-demand in small scale batches.
We're not directly selling products we made ahead of time but are instead collecting interest in the form of handed out options.
Once sufficient options have been requested, we're starting the next production batch and everyone that has previously requested an option can exercise it as soon as the batch is ready.

That's how we ensure to only procude exactly what's needed allowing us to minimize waste.

The process is as follows:

- Upcoming production batch is announced with call for options (CfO)
- Customers place option requests
- Once enough option requests have been collected, options are granted and the CfO is closed
- Raw product for the next production run is ordered
- Production run is started
- Our chili sauces and sambals are lacto-fermented. This is a natural process which takes weeks to months depending on several factors like ambient temperature and batch size.
- Once fermentation commences we're finishing the batch and making it ready for fulfillment
- Customers can now exercise their options by paying for them

Delivery is either by postal service, personal pick-up in Stuttgart, or possibly one of the many events members of our team are attending.
