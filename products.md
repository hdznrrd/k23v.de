We're producing our vintage sauces in pre-order, on-demand batches.
This means we produce exactly what's needed without wasteful overproduction.
On the other hand, this means we cannot fulfill your order right away.
Instead you acquire options on our next production batch which will be fulfilled as soon as the production run is completed.

You can [learn more about how we produce our chili sauces and sambal mixes](/process) or [acquire options](/options) to the results of one of our next production runs.

# LAVA

The "**LAVA**" sauce legacy was started in 2016 with **LAVA16** which was our first stab at a sriracha-style, lacto-fermented Habanero hot sauce.
We produced a very small laboratory batch for experimentation which yielded a product of excellent taste.

We followed this up in 2017 with some minor tweaks to the recipe that resulted in **LAVA17**, improving on the sauce's texture.

Encouraged by excellent feedback on the 2017 vintage we've decided to move forward with 2018's edition based on a similar recipe but augmenting the strong Habanero base with a selection of Scotch Bonnet peppers.

2018 will be the first year we're going to [offer options on the **LAVA18** production batch for purchase](/options).

# SAMBAL - OH, LECK!

"**SAMBAL - OH, LECK!**" is the spicier and more solid sibling of "**LAVA**".
It too is lacto-fermented and based on Habanero chilis (2017) and a mix of Habanero & Scotch Bonnet chilis (2018).

Production yields of "**SAMBAL - OH, LECK!**" are tightly coupled to the "**LAVA**" production and lower volume.
